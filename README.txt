Report for Question 1 


Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  4x128  threads

Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  8x128  threads

Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  16x128 threads

Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  32x128 threads


Why there is less speedup improvement  towards 32x128 threads?

Report for Question 2 

Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  8x128  threads with shared memory

Parallel time for n=4K, t=1K,  32x128 threads with shared memory


Explain the reason if you see an improvement compared to Question 1 code performance.  


Explain the reason if you see less improvement when the total  number of threads increases.

Report for Question 3 
The default number of asynchronous iterations is 5 in a batch.
Parallel time and the number of actual iterations executed  for n=4K, t=1K, 8x128  threads with asynchronous Gauss Seidel


Parallel time and the number of actual ierations executed  for n=4K, t=1K,  32x128 threads with asynchronous Gauss Seidel


Does the above Gauss Seidel -Seidel method converge  faster than the Jacobi method in this case?  
Compare performance with code of Question 1 in the above setting and explain the difference.
